        <blockquote>My head 

          It hurts from the tears
          
          I have shed
          
          It feels like itâ€™s going to burst
          
          I feel so alone and angry
          
          I need to get away
          
          Somewhere no one can hurt me
          
          This pain will ultimately 
          
          Fill you
