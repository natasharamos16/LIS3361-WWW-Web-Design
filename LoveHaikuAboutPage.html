        <p><em>Growing up I never knew who to talk to. I always felt that no one really understood how I felt. I turned to writing.<br>
          Writing poetry has saved my life. I am able to write my feelings and it is like writing the story of my life.<br> 
          I have loved poetry as a little girl and it has helped build confidence and character. I am able create art and share
          my stories with others.<br> I wanted to create this website for individuals like me to be able to express themselves through
          writing.<br> So I created Love Haiku, a place for those who admire poetry and haikus.</em><br></p>
